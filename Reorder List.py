"""You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 104].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000"""

#example usage
# Creating a linked list for demonstration:
node1 = ListNode(1)
node2 = ListNode(2)
node3 = ListNode(3)
node4 = ListNode(4)
node1.next = node2
node2.next = node3
node3.next = node4  
solution = Solution()
solution.reorderList(node1)
# The linked list is now reordered to 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3

"""walkthrough
1. Find the middle of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer technique.
2. Reverse the second half of the linked list.
3. Merge the two halves together in the required order.
4. The function modifies the list in place and does not return anything.
5. The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1)."""
