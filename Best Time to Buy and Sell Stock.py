"""You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104"""

"""walkthrough
1. Initialize two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to represent the buy and sell days respectively. Start with `l` at index 0 and `r` at index 1.
2. Initialize a variable `mp` (max profit) to keep track of the maximum profit found so far, starting at 0.
3. Loop while `r` is less than the length of the prices array:
    - If the price at day `l` is less than the price at day `r`, calculate the profit by subtracting the price at `l` from the price at `r`. Update `mp` if this profit is greater than the current `mp`.
    - If the price at day `l` is not less than the price at day `r`, move the `l` pointer to the current position of `r` (indicating a new potential buy day).
    - Increment the `r` pointer to check the next day.
4. After the loop, return the maximum profit `mp`.
