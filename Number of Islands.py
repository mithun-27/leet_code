"""Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'."""

"""walkthrough:
1. We define a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) class to manage the connected components of the grid.
2. The DSU class has methods for finding the parent of a node and for unioning two nodes.
3. In the Solution class, we initialize the DSU with the total number of cells in the grid.
4. We define a helper function index to convert 2D grid coordinates to a 1D index.
5. We iterate through each cell in the grid. If we find a '1' (land), we increment the island count and check its adjacent cells. If an adjacent cell is also land, we union them in the DSU and decrement the island count.    
6. Finally, we return the total number of islands found in the grid."""
