"""Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"

Output: true

Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"

Output: false

Example 4:

Input: s = "([])"

Output: true

Example 5:

Input: s = "([)]"

Output: false

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

"""walkthrough
1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets.
2. Create a mapping of closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets.
3. Iterate through each character in the string:
   - If the character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket. If it does, pop the top of the stack; otherwise, return False.
   - If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
4. After processing all characters, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return True (all brackets were matched); otherwise, return False.
