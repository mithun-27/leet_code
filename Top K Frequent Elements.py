"""Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2

Output: [1,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1

Output: [1]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2,3,1,3,2], k = 2

Output: [1,2]

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique."""

"""walkthrough
1. We define a class Solution with a method topKFrequent that takes a list of integers nums and an integer k as input.
2. We initialize a dictionary count to store the frequency of each number in nums.
3. We create a list freq of empty lists, where the index represents the frequency of numbers. The size of freq is len(nums) + 1 to accommodate frequencies from 0 to len(nums).
4. We iterate through each number in nums and update its count in the count dictionary.
5. We then iterate through the count dictionary and append each number to the corresponding list in freq based on its frequency.
6. We initialize an empty list res to store the result.
7. We iterate through the freq list in reverse order (from highest frequency to lowest). For each frequency, we iterate through the numbers in that frequency list and append them to res.
8. We check if the length of res has reached k, and if so, we return res as the final output.
