"""You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

Example 1:


Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104"""

"""walkthrough
1. Initialize two pointers, `l` and `r`, at the start and end of the heights array.
2. Initialize a variable `res` to store the maximum area found.
3. While `l` is less than `r`, calculate the area formed by the lines at positions `l` and `r`.
4. Update `res` if the calculated area is greater than the current `res`.
5. Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward (either `l` or `r`) to potentially find a larger area.
6. Return the maximum area found.
